# README
Hi ! Welcome to my github.
Here you will find all the work referencing what I do in the sphere of programming.
Please use all these resources I chose to set as pubic WISELY!
Also keep in mind that I'm still a beginner and I certainly do not have the most safe/optimized code (I'm still a student afterall :).
Have fun !
